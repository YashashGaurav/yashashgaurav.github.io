# My First Taste of Real Research

During my undergrad years at NIT Silchar, I had somehow found an opportunity to work with Jayesh Ruikar on his ongoing research on Image Quality Analysis.

## The What

I contributed to his project to create NIT Silchar's own Image Quality Assessment Database. We were able to write up a paper about the same, comparing it to other IQA Databases. We submitted our paper to IEEE InfoVis 2016 for consideration too!

## What It Meant

This experience was extremely enriching for me as it was the first time I ever worked on an actual Research Project. Before this, the idea of doing research seemed a feat only for very knowledgeable and elite people of the industry. Then on I learnt that I too could contribute to the expansion of knowledge in the world.
