## Abstract

Poetry is a form of literary work that is often characterized by an interplay of words meant to generate an evocative response in the human mind. A limerick is a short humorous form of verse that has five lines and follows the AABBA rhyme scheme. While a lot of research has been done in the field of Natural Language Understanding, the area pertaining to generation and analysis of poetry based on its qualities remains to be explored. This is mainly because poetry is one of the oldest art forms, and the rules guiding it differ significantly depending on the language and culture. Our goal is to use models like GPT-2 which have been successful at text generation for many custom scenarios like summarising, chat bots and even in poetry generation. The clear challenge we foresee is that models must be able to understand what poetry means and what makes them different from conventional text generation tasks. For this, attributes of poetry like rhyme, rhythm, context, and other characteristics of poem must be quantified for models to learn.
