# An Intranet for the Campus, Before the Internet Got Fast

## My Solution — A Campus Cloud on a Raspberry Pi

There was a dire need to set up an intranet file sharing in our campus way back in 2014. Internet was still slow and it did not make sense for us to download the same video or educational resource over and over again. Seeing this need, I requisitioned a Raspberry Pi from the school authorities, housed it with its own SMPs and inverter system to protect it from going down in case of a power failure, and attached it as a server that ran a Ptokax hub on Raspbian. This allowed users to use their own DC Clients to connect to the server and share files across the intranet. I further attached an SSD to the server system to support storing College-wide accessible open resources for everyone to use which would allow persistent access to university-wide digital resources - essentially our own College Cloud.
