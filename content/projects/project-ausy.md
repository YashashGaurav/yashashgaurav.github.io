# Sound-Reactive Party Lights

## Problem Statement

Making the party lights more sound intelligent.

## Our Solution

Using an equalizer module to split sound into bands of frequencies.

Take amplitude values of each frequency band and use them to actuate different light color intensities.

Pass these color intensity values to an addressable LED strip and light up the room!

BAM! Cool party lights!
