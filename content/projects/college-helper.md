Above is the fastest way to know what my team did 😃

## The Why

Picking the right college is one of the most stressful decisions a high school student faces. Data is scattered across dozens of websites — rankings, acceptance rates, tuition, campus life — and comparing schools side-by-side requires hours of manual research. We wanted to change that by aggregating everything into one place and surfacing insights through visualizations.

## The What

College Helper scrapes, cleans, and analyses college data so students can make more informed decisions. Key features:

- **Web Scraping** — Automated data collection from multiple college listing sites using Selenium and BeautifulSoup
- **Data Cleaning & Analysis** — Processed raw data with Pandas and NumPy to produce consistent, comparable metrics across schools
- **Visualisations** — Generated charts and graphs with Matplotlib to highlight trends in acceptance rates, tuition costs, and more
- **Search & Filter** — Allowed users to filter schools by criteria such as location, major, acceptance rate, and cost
