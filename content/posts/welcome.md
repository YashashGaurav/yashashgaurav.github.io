# Welcome!

Hi there! I'm Yashash, an Applied Scientist at [Ripple Labs](https://ripple.com) in San Francisco, where I work on LLM systems, retrieval, evaluation, and latency-efficient inference. I'm also a proud [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) alum.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is my space to share insights, experiences, and learnings from the fascinating world of AI and machine learning. You can expect posts about:

### 🤖 AI & Machine Learning
- **LLM Systems**: Architecture deep-dives and practical implementations
- **Retrieval Systems**: From vector databases to semantic search
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics, benchmarks, and real-world assessment
- **Inference Optimization**: Making models faster and more efficient

### 🧠 Algorithms & Problem Solving
- **LeetCode Insights**: Patterns and approaches I've discovered
- **Algorithm Design**: From theory to practical applications
- **Optimization Techniques**: Both in code and in life

### 🌉 Life in SF Tech
- **AI Meetups**: Highlights from the vibrant SF AI community
- **Industry Insights**: Observations from working in fintech
- **Career Journey**: From CMU to Ripple and everything in between

## My Background

Currently, I'm focused on:
- 🔭 **Deep-diving LLM architecture** and understanding what makes them tick
- 📊 **Sharpening algorithms** through consistent LeetCode practice
- 🤝 **Connecting with the AI community** at local SF meetups
- 📚 **Reading widely** (big StarTalk fan ⭐) and capturing moments through photography

## Tech Stack

**Currently Working With:**
- Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS

**Also Experienced In:**
