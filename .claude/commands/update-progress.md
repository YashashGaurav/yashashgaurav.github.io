description: Update documentation after completing work
---

Update documentation after completing work:

1. Read `docs/project_spec.md`
2. Mark completed tasks with `[x]`
3. Add brief notes on what was built under the milestone
4. If structural changes occurred (new folders, data files, layouts), also update `docs/architecture_spec.md`
